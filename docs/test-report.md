# Test report

Latest: GitHub Actions run 39642523078, workflow `windows-release`, on a GitHub-hosted **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter
10.0.20348** VM. Release: `v1.1.1-build.78` (pre-release, **unsigned**), package version **1.1.1.78**. Results: unit +
PostgreSQL integration tests **236 PASS, 2 skipped** (the live MeshCentral and live SNMP tests run in ci-quick: PASS, 238/238);
installer acceptance **60 passed, 0 failed**; in-place updates PASS (database migration V0022).

New in build 78 (manufacturer, model and serial number entered manually, remembered by SMBIOS UUID and MAC):

| ID | Test | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| T70 | Manual hardware details | **PASS** | saved and linked to 2 fixed identities of the test server; its detected serial number kept priority; device found by the entered serial; 201 characters refused; removed |
| — | PostgreSQL / unit tests | **PASS** | firmware placeholders ("To be filled by O.E.M.", "Default string", "0000000000") are not values; entered values come back on a new record with the same SMBIOS UUID and MAC; not applied when only the MAC matches and the UUID differs; clearing removes the profile |

Build 77 (run 39633522889): console start page sent with `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store`, hashed assets `immutable` (T23 checks the headers) - all tests PASS.

## Build and packaging

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `build.ps1` (.NET SDK, NuGet audit, warnings-as-errors for vulnerable packages, web console `tsc` + Vite build) | PASS |
| `test.ps1` – unit + PostgreSQL integration tests | PASS – total=45 passed=45 failed=0 |
| `package-windows.ps1` – server publish, Zentriq Agent (.NET Framework 4.8) build, ZentriqAgent-x64.msi, Zentriq.msi (ICE validation), Burn bundle, checksums, manifest | PASS |
| Code signing | NOT RUN – no signing certificate configured; artifacts are unsigned (Windows shows "Unknown publisher" / SmartScreen "Run anyway") |

New unit/integration tests in 1.1: Windows (WMI/registry), Linux (SSH output) and SNMP inventory mapping; enrollment
code format and server key pin; agent CA issue/validate/weak-key refusal; credential encryption bound to its record;
inventory persistence against PostgreSQL (agent + agentless records of one device merge into one asset, software list
replaced) and the trial's 30-device total cap.

Notes:
* T28 scans the CI machine itself; for that self-scan the test sets `DisableLoopbackCheck` (NTLM refuses authentication
  to a machine's own DNS alias). An earlier run without it failed with "Access is denied", which is how this
  limitation was found; it does not apply to scanning other machines.
* T26 originally failed: the enrollment code appeared in the agent MSI log (`RegAddValue`). Fixed by writing the
  code through a hidden deferred custom action; the test now asserts the code is absent from the log.
* The trial-policy migration for existing 1.0.x installations (250/25/50/50 → 30 devices) was verified on
  PostgreSQL 16 locally (old trial row updated, immutability trigger re-enabled). Upgrading a real 1.0.2 installation
  to 1.1.0 was **not** run in CI (CI upgrades 1.1.0 → 1.1.1).

## Not yet verified

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Interactive wizards (server and agent MSI dialogs) on a VM | NOT RUN – silent installs exercise the same actions |
| Upgrade from the published 1.0.2 build to 1.1.0 | NOT RUN in CI (migration verified on PostgreSQL directly) |
| Agentless SSH (Linux/macOS), SNMP, Active Directory sync/scan against real systems | NOT RUN – parsers unit-tested; AD connection errors tested (T37) |
| Password reset e-mail delivery through a real SMTP server | NOT RUN |
| Setup on Windows Server 2016, and refusal on Server 2012 R2 | NOT RUN – CI has Windows Server 2022 only |
| Firewalled-host detection (ARP/ICMP) on a real LAN | NOT RUN |
| Agent over the internet / through a reverse proxy, proxy (`PROXYURL`) | NOT RUN |
| Agent on Windows 10/11 clients and Server 2016/2019 | NOT RUN – CI used Windows Server 2022 |
| Windows reboot persistence | NOT RUN |
| Trial expiry and valid commercial license end-to-end | Unit tests only |
| Signed installers / SmartScreen behaviour | NOT RUN – needs a code-signing certificate |
| Installation with an existing PostgreSQL server | NOT RUN |
